# Project Description
This project is a homework assignment intended to teach how to setup PyCharm with Docker, Flask, MySQL, and Postman.

In this project you will need to create a REST API and use Postman to test the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE request methods.  You will need to get the professor's project to run so that you can review how everything works.  You will then need to create you own project with new data, but still have the same functionality.

## Assignment Three
 1. Get the professor's code to work
 2. Build your REST API and test wit Postman using a CSV from this [source](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html).
 3. Convert the CSV to an SQL insert to use as your Database Data.
 4. Submit a link to your GitHub repository showing your new project data.  
 5. Include screenshots of the following items:
     * [Your project showing Postman listing all records](https://github.com/kb8njit/WebAppHW/blob/Assignment4/screenshots/Assignment%204/Postman_List%20of%20all%20Entries_GET.png)
